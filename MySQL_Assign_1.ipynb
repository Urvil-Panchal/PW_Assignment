    "Primary Key (PK): In a relational database, a primary key is a unique identifier for a specific record in a table. It ensures the uniqueness and integrity of data within the table. A primary key constraint enforces the rule that no two records can have the same primary key value. Typically, a primary key is chosen from one or more columns that uniquely identify each record. It facilitates data retrieval, data integrity, and the establishment of relationships between tables.\n",

    "Foreign Key (FK): A foreign key is a field or a combination of fields in a table that refers to the primary key of another table. It establishes a relationship between two tables, known as a parent-child relationship. The foreign key ensures referential integrity by enforcing that the values in the foreign key column(s) of the child table must match the values in the primary key column(s) of the parent table. It allows for data consistency and enables the creation of relationships and joins between tables, enabling the representation of complex data relationships in a database."
